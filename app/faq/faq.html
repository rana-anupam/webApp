                            Damage which makes the furniture functionally unusable is chargeable. The amount will be decided by Hocket on a case to case basis. Normal wear and tear which does not cause functional damage to the products due to usage is absolutely free.

                          <br>
                          <span class="faqContent">
                            You can request for early termination of the contract by informing us 2 weeks prior to your preferred closure date. You would need to pay the difference in monthly rental rates between your 'Contract tenure' (the tenure selected at order placement) and 'Actual tenure' (effective tenure at early closure). The amount due will be calculated as: (Actual tenure rent - Contract tenure rent) * No. of months of actual tenure. The applicable tenure rates for early closure are:
                            <ul>
                            <li>Upto 3 month's: Full 3 month's rental due</li>
                            <li>3-6 month's: 3 month's rental rate</li>
                            <li>6-9 month's: 6 month's rental rate</li>
                            <li>9-12 month's: 9 month's rental rate</li>
                            <li>12-18th month's: 12 month's rental rate</li>
                            <li>18-24 month's: 18 month's rental rate</li>
                             </ul>
                            Similarly, the contract for your order/one or more items from the order can be extended for the desired period by notifying us 2 weeks prior to the end of the contract.

                            We will call you one week prior to the scheduled end date of the contract to fix the pick-up date and time.

                            We will pick up the products on the completion of your rental tenure, and upon successful Quality Check, we will immediately initiate the refund of your security deposit to your registered bank account in 5 working days. No interest is paid on the deposit amount.

                            We make sure all the products are new or almost new when they reach without compromise on quality.

                            You can request for early termination of the contract by informing us 2 weeks prior to your preferred closure date. You would need to pay the difference in monthly rental rates between your 'Contract tenure' (the tenure selected at order placement) and 'Actual tenure' (effective tenure at early closure). The amount due will be calculated as: (Actual tenure rent - Contract tenure rent) * No. of months of actual tenure. The applicable tenure rates for early closure are:
                            <ul>
                            <li>Upto 3 month's: Full 3 month's rental due</li>
                            <li>3-6 month's: 3 month's rental rate</li>
                            <li>6-9 month's: 6 month's rental rate</li>
                            <li>9-12 month's: 9 month's rental rate</li>
                            <li>12-18th month's: 12 month's rental rate</li>
                            <li>18-24 month's: 18 month's rental rate</li>
                             </ul>
                            Similarly, the contract for your order/one or more items from the order can be extended for the desired period by notifying us 2 weeks prior to the end of the contract.
